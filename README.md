# Digital-Marketing-Analytics
This project looked into Maximizing Return On Investment with Data-Driven Ad Campaign Optimization using Power BI.
In todayâ€™s competitive digital landscape, e-commerce businesses must navigate the complexities of ad campaigns to optimize spending and maximize returns. In My project with FreshCart, an online grocery store, showcased my expertise in data analytics and visualization, helping the company fine-tune its digital marketing efforts. This case study highlights how I used Power BI to extract actionable insights that revolutionized FreshCart's ad strategy and significantly improved their Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).
## Business Overview/Problem.
FreshCart, like many e-commerce platforms, relies heavily on online advertising to acquire new customers and retain existing ones. However, in the midst of an increasingly competitive market and fluctuating ad costs, the company has identified two main challenges:

1. **Inefficient Ad Spend:** The company suspects that not every dollar spent on digital advertising is yielding the desired ROI. Some campaigns may be costing more than they return in revenue.
2. **Identifying Effective Channels:** With multiple platforms available for advertising, from search engines to social media, FreshCart is finding it challenging to determine which channels offer the best return on investment.
As the competition in the online grocery sector has skyrocketed, the cost of customer acquisition is rising. FreshCart is looking for the most efficient way to save cost and optimize its digital ad spend.
## Rationale for the Project.
Marketing analytics is the process of using data to understand how marketing campaigns perform and find how to improve them. It helps businesses know which strategies work best, where to spend money, and how to better connect with customers.
By analyzing the performance of different advertising channels, FreshCart can:
- Identify demography or regions where the ads perform best.
- Understand which campaigns are under or over-funded and reallocate funds accordingly.
- Determine which platforms or strategies yield the highest return.
## Aim of the Project.
The aim of this project is to analyze FreshCart past advertising data and create a strategy to optimize their digital ad spending. The specific objectives are:
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of current advertising campaigns across platforms.
2. Identify top-performing channels for advertising.
3. Assess demography engagement and conversion rates.
4. Recommend strategies for better budget allocation.

**YouTube or Twitter:** Which Platform is the most effective platform for Ad Campaigns?

So far, **YouTube** has been the most effective platform for Fresh Cart's advertising. 
Here are the reasons:
1. **High Conversion Rate:** Both YouTube (6.41%) and Twitter (6.79%) have conversion rates that exceed the e-commerce industry's
average of 1-3%, meaning their audience are highly receptive to FreshCart's ads.
2. **Lowest Cost Per Conversion:** YouTube's Cost Per Conversion ($2.72) is significantly lower than Twitter ($14.21), which is more
than 5 times higher than YouTube's. This indicates the cost-effectiveness of the platform in converting viewers into customers.
3. **Impressive ROAS:** The Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) for YouTube stands at an impressive 1298.84%. This means that Fresh Cart
gets $12.99 in return for every dollar it spends on YouTube advertising. This is significantly higher than the ROAS on other platforms,
including Twitter (420.18%).
4. **Efficiency:** YouTube generates more sales than Twitter, even with fewer campaigns (9 vs. 12) and shorter ad durations.
- Considering all these factors, ***YouTube*** is the most effective platform for Fresh Cart's advertising. It offers a combination of high
conversion rates, maximum sales revenue, an impressive ROAS, and the lowest cost per conversion, all while requiring fewer
campaigns and shorter durations. This makes it a highly cost-effective and efficient platform for Fresh Cart's advertising needs.

**Which is the Least effective Platform for Ad Campaign?**
Based on the analysis, Google Ads has been the least effective or potentially overfunded platform for Fresh Cart's advertising.
Here's why:
1. **Lowest Conversion Rate:** Google Ads has the lowest conversion rate at 4.62%, which is notably lower than the conversion rates
of the other platforms.
2. **Highest CPC:** Google Ads also has the highest Cost per Conversion at $35, making it the most expensive platform in terms of
acquiring a customer.
3. **Least ROAS:** In terms of ROAS, Google Ads is at the bottom with 180.88%. While this is still a positive return, it's considerably
lower than the other platforms.
4. Google Ads generated sales revenue of $8.07K, which is higher than Instagram but significantly lower than YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.

## Recommendations.
**YouTube**
1. **Invest more in YouTube:** Given its high ROAS, low cost per conversion, and significant sales revenue, Consider increasing the
budget allocation for YouTube advertising. This platform offers a cost-effective way to acquire customers.
2. **Analyze Successful Campaigns:** Deep dive into the top performing YouTube campaigns to identify the types of content that
resonate best with the audience on the platform.
3. Explore the possibility of running more campaigns or extending the duration of existing successful ones to capitalize on its
performance.

**Twitter**
1. **Optimize Twitter Spend:** While Twitter has a good conversion rate and significant sales revenue, the ROAS and cost per
conversion suggest there's room for optimization. Investigate areas for optimization on Twitter. Consider refining ad targeting,
creative content, and evaluating the performance of individual campaigns to ensure better returns.
2. **Analyze Successful Campaigns:** Deep dive into the top performing Twitter campaigns to identify the types of content that
resonate best with the audience on the platform.

**Google Ads**
- Reassess Google Ads Strategy:
1. While Google Ads has an above-average conversion rate compared to industry standards, it lags behind other platforms in terms
of ROAS, sales revenue, and has the highest cost per conversion for FreshCart.
2. Consider revisiting the keywords targeted, ad creatives, and landing pages to optimize performance.
3. Conduct a deeper analysis to identify if certain campaigns or ad groups within Google Ads are underperforming and refine
accordingly.
Overall, Explore Retargeting Strategies across all platforms If not already in use. Implement retarget campaigns, especially on
platforms where visitors might not have converted the first time. This can help improve overall conversion rates.

In conclusion, while Fresh Cart has experienced successes across multiple platforms, there's always room for optimization and
growth. By focusing on these recommendations, Fresh Cart can further enhance its digital advertising efficiency and effectiveness.
